### Podcast like web app

## Description

ABOUT THE APP: We want to build a simple podcast website where users will be able to listen to audios of different categories/genre and also upload their own creation too. Users will be able to look for audios according to what they like with the help of a search bar or choose for the list displayed on the homepage. An user will be able to browse through the website without creating an account but will have to register if they want to upload their own audio.<br>

HOMEPAGE: The home page will have a layout with a list of categories and displaying thumbnails of audios available under that category with titles on them. We will be using a slider so that the user will be able to slide horizontally to explore more audios staying on the home page.<br>

MY PLAYLIST: This page will be accessible only to account holders who wants to upload their files and see their playlist.<br>
Creators will be able to upload, edit or delete their content from this page. They will have options to change their profile picture too. We will be adding a small "about me" section for the creator.<br>

SEARCH: Users will be able to search for audios on this page. When they select an audio from the search list, it will redirect them to a simple audio player to listen to the chosen audio. The search page also features a list of all the available audio categories on the website. When a user selects a category, they will be redirected to the list of audios available in that specific category.<br>

AUDIO LIST: The audio list page contains a list of audios within a particular category. In the list, there will be more details about each audio, such as a small thumbnail, title, description, and a play button to redirect the user to the audio player page for listening.<br>

PLAYER: The player will display details of the selected audio and allow users to play, pause, fast-forward, and rewind. It will showcase a larger thumbnail of the audio, along with the title and description.<br>

UPLOAD FORM: This page will be used to upload audio files. There will be fields to add title, description and thumbnail of the audio file. A drop down button will be used for choosing genre of the of the file so that we can attach it to the correct category.<br>

PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE: we will be using are HTML,CSS, JavaScript and PHP to build the whole project.
For back-end we will be using PHP and for database we will use phpMyAdmin. After presenting our UI/UX we will start with HTML and CSS. And then, for the database initially we are planning to use four tables (audioUsers, audios, audioGenres and audioGenreLink).<br>

WORK DISTRIBUTION: We are a group of three and all of us has been very much involved with what we did so far. We discussed about the UI/UX and created a rough design in Figma. After Tischa started with the Homepage design and then we started working for our assigned tasks. Tischa later took care of front-end and modification where needed. Maiko took the responsibility for the My Playlist, Login and Sign-up (Front and Back-end). Tanveer did the Upload, Search, Audio-List, Music Player and Dynamic Homepage Sliders. More details of the work we did is described in the last section of this case study.
